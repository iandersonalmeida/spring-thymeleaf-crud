# Spring Boot with Thymeleaf
This application covers Spring Boot concepts, MVC architecture and Thymeleaf,<br> using the four basic operations performed on a relational database, the CRUD.

# Description
Spring Boot features automatic provision of the configuration for application functionality and the necessary development libraries or dependencies.<br> With the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture that separates the development of an application into these three layers, the technology used to display information to the user or the view layer can operate with different technologies or templates. <br> The technology used in this application is Thymeleaf which provides a way to create and process HTML, TEXT, XML, JavaScript, CSS and RAW templates. The application allows at runtime to perform operations on the database.
